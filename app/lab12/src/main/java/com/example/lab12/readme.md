# Unit 3: Material Design and Scrollable Lists

One of the interesting concepts I learned in Unit 3 was Material Design. The design language
provides a big set of guidelines for creating aesthetic and user-friendly Android apps. I was
particularly interested by the emphasis on consistency and accessibility, which can improve the
overall app user experience.

Another concept was building scrollable lists. This is a fundamental UI element that allows users to
view large amounts of data, and are used mostly in all scrollable modern apps. I found it cool to
learn how to create scrollable lists in Jetpack Compose, using the LazyColumn and LazyRow
components. The ability to efficiently handle large datasets is crucial for building scalable and
performant apps.

# Unit 4: Architecture Components: ViewModels

In Unit 4, I looked more into ViewModels, an architecture component that simplifies state management
in Android apps. ViewModels can help decouple UI logic from business logic, making the codebase more
maintainable and testable. By using ViewModels to store and manage UI-related data, I can ensure
that data is retained even when the activity or fragment is recreated, such as during screen
rotation.

Overall, Units 3 and 4 provided a solid foundation for building modern Android apps with Jetpack
Compose.
